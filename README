-- OVERVIEW

Maiter2 is modified based on Piccolo.

-- PREREQUISITES

To build and use Maiter2, you will need a minimum of the following:

* CMake (> 2.6)
* OpenMPI
* gcc/g++ (> 4.8 ,or others with C++11 support)
* protocol buffers

In addition to these, Maiter2 comes with several support libraries which are 
compiled as part of the build process; these are:

* google-flags
* google-logging


On debian/ubuntu, the required libraries can be acquired by running:

sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake g++ liblzo2-dev libopenmpi-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
 
-- BUILDING

To build, simply run 'make' from the toplevel Maiter2 directory.  After building
output should be available in the bin/ directory.  Specifically, a successful
build should generate a bin/{debug,release}/examples/example-dsm binary.

-- RUNNING


--- Configure your cluster

To execute a Maiter2 program, you will need to modify conf/mpi-cluster
to point to the set of machines Maiter2 will be executed on - for example, a file
might look like:

localhost slots=1
a slots=4
b slots=4
c slots=4

Which would allow for running up to 12 workers (+ 1 master process).
